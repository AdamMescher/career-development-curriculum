# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals
*List your longterm goal(s) of what you want to accomplish by the end of module 4*
* I want to have a job offer by the end of Mod 4

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
* I will get at least one interview for every week in Mod 4
* Every day I will do one of the following:
  - Apply for a job
  - Email a contact person
  - Have a face to face meeting

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
*How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?*
* I need to build a portfolio I can show off to people. Towards this end, I will:
  - Build out POODR, Cloney Island
  
#### Opportunities Research:
*How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 
* I will research consultancies in my target cities
* I will look for apprenticeships at larger companies

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?
* I will reach out to appropriate people at the companies I identify as good matches

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
*How might personal branding pieces help you towards your goal?*
* I'm going to apply for jobs that I probably am underqualified for. To help my chances:
  - Write technical blog posts
  - Build out personal site

  - Have a list of at least a dozen companies worth contacting

* After intermission week:
  - Prioritize the job search
  
#### Module Tasks:
*What will you do throughout the module?*
* Whatever's on the calendar

#### Weekly Tasks:
*What will you do throughout each week?*
* I will get at least one interview for every week in Mod 4
