# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals

I would like to have interviewed with at least one company.
I would like 3-4 strong leads on places I would like to work.


### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
I will identify 3-4 companies that I would be interested in working for, reach out about their stack and focus, and tailor my capstone project for it.

#### Opportunities Research:
*How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
Before Dinosaur JS in June, I would like to have my personal website complete w/ 2-3 deployed projects in it and an HTMl version of my resume.

### Timeline:
*What will you do when?*

#### Module Tasks:
*What will you do throughout the module?*

#### Weekly Tasks:
*What will you do throughout each week?*
