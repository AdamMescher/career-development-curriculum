# Feedback II Reflection

* Date of feedback conversation: 

5/10/17

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 

I prepared these talking points:
  - I like how the team handled the come together moments and find a consensus or choose a direction when encountering a problem
  - We split up work and worked together in an effective way

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

* Any other comments:
