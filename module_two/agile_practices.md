# Agile Practices & Software Collaboration

## Connections: The Why
....

All the things:
* Why...
* Waterfall vs. Agile
  * Intro the manifesto but mention that we'll come back to it later to discuss its merits and flaws -- this will be about students being able to take ownership of their learning in the software industry
  * Turn & Talk: how do you already see agile being used in your processes at Turing? 
* What Agile looks like as a process
* Project Management tools & resources (waffle, XP, Git Workflow, etc.)
* How teams work together (Tuckman's, SCRUM, Honesty, Treating team members as more than just the work they do, Goal Setting, Accountability, Retrospective and review)
  * Bring in readings?
  * Strengths leadership here?
* Discussions:
  * Build own "manifesto" or principles on how teams should work
* Project group break-outs:
  * Discuss strengths leadership domains and what systems you'll put into place
* Final takeaway: how will you continue to apply these days during the rest of your time at Turing? 

Deliverable ideas:
* Describe plan to utilize agile as a process at Turing -- what were you already doing, what did you put into place in M2...
* Reflections on how you're a leader and a teammate, reflecting on your strengths
* Storytelling component (could be part of a different session?): How will you contribute to the betterment of these processes in your future as a dev?
