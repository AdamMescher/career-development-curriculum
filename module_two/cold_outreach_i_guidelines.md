# Documentation Guidelines for Cold Outreach I Deliverable:

* Name of contact
  * "The mentor and alum I contacted is Tan"

* Date of contact
  * "06/23/2017"

* Outcome (i.e., did you get a response? If not, what is your follow-up plan? Did you meet? When? What was the result?)

  *  Tan and I connected through the TAAP Turing channel. We try to meet once every week. He comes on-campus and we pair on my homework/projects.

* How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development? 

  *  Tan is a great mentor because he pushes me to learn new things outside of what Turing is teaching. He is currently teaching me Javascript and Vim. I feel like my relationship with Tan will make me a better programmer.
