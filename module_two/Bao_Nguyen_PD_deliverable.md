Date of feedback conversation: Wednesday May 10th, 2017

How did you prepare for the conversation?

I prepared for the conversation by thinking about what to say to my group partners and how to say it. I think about the body
language involved and I visualize how the conversation will go.

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?

The conversation went well. We talked about how the last few days went with the project. We also discussed pairing more
and working together in the beginning to help with solving a few conceptual problems.

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

I used the coaching and appreciation principles.
