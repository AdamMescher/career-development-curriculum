# Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?  
Based on the feedback I received, I am a capable, intelligent partner who is good at communicating without being aggressive or egotistical.

* How do you use your strengths as a team member? 
My empathy and enjoyment of teaching helps me in a team setting to fit into the setting in a productive way (i.e. either splitting work, providing advise, or doing more driver-navigator work.

* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths? 
3 of 5 said I was assertive. I want to make sure I am that in a productive positive way. 

* What are you working to improve on as a teammate? 
I am continuing to work on how I can be the most communicative, collaborative and productive member of the team.
