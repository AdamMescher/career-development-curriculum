# Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?

After many pairing sessions, I have made substantial strides in my ability to make decisions in a collaborative manner, speaking through why I feel that the choice I am about to make is the right one but willing to listen to my partner and their perspective to avoid making dumb errors. From the feedback session, my former partner felt that I was very good at communicating why I was acting and what was coming next. 


* How do you use your strengths as a team member?

I have used my analytical strength to approach problems with a level head, ready to understand the root and how to move forward as a result. 

I have used my relator strength to build bonds with my teammates that last beyond the project's completion date. These bonds will only strengthen over time and will be valuable as we all struggle to the finish of the Turing program. 


* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?

I would like to further my realtor strength to build stronger relationships. I also want to make sure that when I am being analytical that my analysis does not come across as too cold. 


* What would you like to improve on as a teammate? 

I hope to be better at communicating when we're not pair programming. Even with slack notifications on my phone, my response time for pull requests leaves room 

* How would you like your teammates to see you?

I want my teammates to see me as someone who is calm and competent even when struggle hits. I want them to see me as a someone they can trust so we can both make mistakes together.
