 *This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*
 
 ## Module 4 Goals
 *List your longterm goal(s) of what you want to accomplish by the end of module 4*
 
 Job Offer
 
 ### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
 In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
 
 - Personal site completed by Mod 3 end date
 - Begin cold outreach by end of Mod 3, need to target a couple compainies first
 - Meetup at least once every 2 weeks
 - Professional 1 on 1 meetups on a consistent basis
 
 #### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
 *How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?*
 
 Polish personal site and showcase projects. 
 
 #### Opportunities Research:
 *How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 
 
 I'm very open to companies/industries, so oddly enough it makes it more difficult to pin-point companies. 
 
 #### Cold Outreach/Network:
 *Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?
 
 Need to touch base with past work contacts and see if there's any potential warm out-reach. 
 
 #### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
 *How might personal branding pieces help you towards your goal?*
 
I'm not a fan of personal branding. I'd like to try writing medium articles. 

 ### Timeline:
 *What will you do when?*
 
 See goal strategy. 
 
 #### Module Tasks:
 *What will you do throughout the module?*
 
 #### Weekly Tasks:
 *What will you do throughout each week?*
 
 Weekly job hunt time. This Weekly task includes scheduling more job hunt time for the upcoming week. 
 
 ## What I Will Work on with Meg
 *What advice do you need? What would be helpful to talk through? Let Meg know here!*
 
 I've never met Meg! I'd like to talk about how much "fakeness" I have to be in order to "impress" hiring folks. I'm also in a wierd place where my past failures in job hunting haunt my confidence moving forward. I feel I have to keep un-invested in any oppurtunity as I feel any oppurtunity is destined for failure. Oddly enough, I blame over-confidence for past failures. So overall my self-feedback now restricts any enthusiasm for job searching, while in the past I felt much more confident in my ability to land a gig. Now that same confidence feels wrong and makes my efforts seem to be in vain.
