## Mod 2 Deliverables:
#### Name of contact
  Jonah Moses

#### Date of contact
  April 28th, 2017

#### Outcome:
  He responded almost immediately and is open to lending his time over the next mod. 

#### How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development?
  Jonah seems like a nice guy. He told me to hit him up with any questions, or problems we encounter down the road. At this point I can't speculate beyond saying it will be nice to have some insight on how what we're learning now translates in the real world.
  
### Reflection on agile practices and project management

Agile practices seem like they will be more helpful as our projects get larger in scope and teams become more compartmentalized and complicated. The projects this mod were all individual or with a single partner, making communication and development relatively simple. As it stands, our opportunity to use an agile approach has been rather limited. The merits of approaching a project with agile practices are obvious, however, and as we move forward I'm sure there will be more chances for implementation.

### In-person feedback conversations

Date of feedback conversation:
  April 10

How did you prepare for the conversation?
  Didn't really. Went to the bar and figured it out over brews.

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?
  The conversation was easy. Chris is a reasonable, intelligent fella. We worked well together

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
  Common human courtesy

### What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?

How do you use your strengths as a team member?
  Try to empathize and be flexible with my team members preferred work style.

How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?
  More and more practice

What would you like to improve on as a teammate?
  I understand the concepts and working application of what we've learned, but the articulation of programming concepts using the proper lingo in a conversational sense is still difficult. It's all practice though.

How would you like your teammates to see you?
  Hopefully a pleasure to work with
