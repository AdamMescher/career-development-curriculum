# Student PD Deliverable Submissions

To submit your deliverables, click on the folder for your cohort, and find your name. Students should clone their individual file and update it with links to your specific deliverables before making a Pull Request. 

If feedback is needed for a deliverable, you'll hear from Allison or Meg with information on what needs to be updated before a deliverable is considered final. If you don't hear from Allison or Meg, you can assume that your deliverable was accepted.
