# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
I will treat job searching exactly like i did my door to door copier sales. I will not be as annoying however haha...
3 days a week I will do: Monday morning research/email catch up after weekend. Wednesdays will be cold out reach. studies show that Wed
is the ideal day in the work week for cold out reach. Friday is follow up/meetings. Moods are good, which makes a great convo starter!
## Module 4 Goals
have at least 6 interviews by mods end

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
Action plan is MWF minimum 1 hour during lunch
keep in mind that every 20 reachouts will net 1 deal(action)

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
I really want to get a great grasp of JS. this will make me more marketable. I believe doing as many reps as possible witll be the best use!

#### Opportunities Research:
Start with my connections and then branch from there. Also look at "happiest work environment/built in colorado"

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
I have reached out to a few Alums but I have no issues reaching high in the hiring chain and slowly getting to the right person

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
I will need to work with Meg to develop this.

### Timeline:
3 hours a week is not a lot to ask for.

## What I Will Work on with Meg
Personal branding, and company research.
I know so little about what company size would be best for me etc etc
