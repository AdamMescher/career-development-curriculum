## Practice Interview Reflection (Ian Douglas)

* We covered general interest questions, technical questions, coding challenge

* I did well at the technical, depth of knowledge questions, admitting to what I didn't know along the way. 

* I need to keep practicing coding challenges using Project Euler. 

* It didn't seem that hard. The coding challenge is the hardest part.

## Action Plan for Job Search 

limit to around 30 companies, build up 5-7 a week to get started 
hover around that number until hired 

*keep track of when you send out applications 
*send out 2-3 emails over the course of five business days
*send emails early in the morning 

*if company doesn't get back within a month put said company to inactive on job board

*ask if the company is open to pair programming -> find an excuse to get at the company office

apply to company 
-> reach out to high level person in company (CTO, senior dev, team lead) 
-> use coffee date to get advice (ask questions about org, ask about tech in general, ask about any steps I can take to compete within the organization better amongst other applicants)
-> follow up based on context of conversation
